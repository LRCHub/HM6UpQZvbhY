Look, I ain't got nothin' to say to you
I can't even believe you
You know what? I'm too fly for this shit
You playin' yourself

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no, no, no

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time

Look nigga, what you think this is?
You treatin' me like a random chick?
You done forgot, who introduced you to rocks
And poppin' all that Crist' and shit

Who let you hit it from the back any way that you liked
And any debts, I can pay the price
I thought I was a chick you would make yo' wife, damn
And now a bitch can't even stay the night? You whack

I can't even look in your face without wantin' to slap you
Damn, I thank God, I ain't get that tattoo
You better thank God, I ain't have the strap boo
You ain't even worth lettin' Trick get at you

Matter of fact, Trick get at dude
I'm convinced, I ain't got shit to ask you
And tell that triflin' bitch, she can have you
I ain't lookin' at you no more, I'm lookin' past you

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no, no, no

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time

When my girl came through with the news
All I did was think about me and you like, "Damn"
What a chick gotta do to get with a real nigga
That know how to stay true like man, man

Know one quarter to eight, you better hop on the bus or a cab
I shed so many tears, can't believe how many years
'The Baddest Bitch' put up with yo' dusty ass, yeah
Now you know that I'm the Queen of Miami

All that loud talkin', lyin', save that shit for your mammy
Sounds like, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, bla, blah, bla"
I'm like uh, huh, uh, huh, okay, okay
Whassup, whassup, shut up

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no more no more

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time

Now all my ladies say if you feel the same
If you can't take no more say,? No, no, no?? No, no, no?
No, no, no

Here we go, here we go again
Now you're tellin' me, that she is just a friend
Then why's she callin' you at three o'clock in the mornin'
I can't take this no more, no, no, no

That's why I'm grabbin' up my jewels, grabbin' up my purse
I'll be back for all my shoes and purses, watch me fly
In the seven forty-five while I'm ridin' out
'Cause I ain't tryin' to hear it, not this time
